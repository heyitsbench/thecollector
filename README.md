== Introduction ==
The Collector displays a list of all mounts, companions (minipets), and titles that your character hasn't collected yet. It takes into account factors such as your faction, class, or profession.

== Basic Features ==
* Show missing companions (minipets)
* Show missing mounts
* Show missing titles
* Ignore List
* Tooltip information on where to obtain missing items

== Usage ==
=== Opening the Collector window ===
To open the Collector window open the pet/mount tab (Shift-P) from your Character window and click the Toggle button in the upper right corner. Or you can use the slash command "/tc show". This will open a window that shows what you are missing for that tab. With the window open you can easily switch between tabs to see what you still need to collect.

=== Slash Commands ===
* /thecollector or /tc will display the usage text
* /thecollector show or /tc show will bring up the main window
* /thecollector config or /tc config will bring up the configuration window
* /thecollector reset or /tc reset will center the main window on the screen

=== Ignore List ===
You can add items to an ignore list by right-clicking them and selecting Mark as Inactive. This is useful if for some reason you will never be able to obtain that item and don't want to continue tracking it. Inactive items are placed in a list at the bottom of the missing items. To track an item again, simply right-click it in the Inactive list and select Mark as Active.

This addon was largely inspired by AckisRecipeList. If you're looking for a similar addon to tell you what tradeskill/profession recipes you're missing, check it out.

Description:
This addon displays a list of all mounts, companions (minipets), or titles that your character hasn't learned yet. It takes into account factors such as your faction, class, or profession.

Since Blizzard created a whole storage area for companions and mounts in WotLK, collecting multiple items is now even more fun. If you're a completionist, then The Collector is for you.

The Collector is now a stand-alone window. To open it type on your chat line, "/thecollector show", or "/tc show". This will open a window that shows what you are missing for that tab. With the window open you can easily switch between the Companions and Mounts tab to see what you still need to collect.

This addon was largely inspired by (and borrowed heavily from) AckisRecipeList. If you're looking for a similar addon to tell you what tradeskill/profession recipes you're missing, check it out.


To Do:
  -  Most of the items should be in the addon now. If you have learned something that this addon doesn't know about, it will display the following text in the default chat frame: 
  "WARNING - TheCollector didn't have spellID:xxx name:yyy in its database. Please contact the mod author."
If you see this message, please contact me with the spellID and name that is reported at either skeevesm AT gmail DOT com, or at this website.
